# 2022

**Mentors**: Giannis Skitsas, Ilias Kyranas

**Assignee**: Kanha Agrawal

## Abstract

It was a forked project from the [http-traffic-simulator](https://github.com/iskitsas/http-traffic-simulator) npm package, which was developed to provide simulated throttled http traffic for testing purposes, towards specific http endpoints. For GSoC 2022, the goal was to make this npm package a stand-alone desktop app as well as offer it as a web-server exposing the apis that even supports the authentication and authorization with OpenIDC. And further dockerize the app and deploy it to kubernetes. This way it will be offered as a stand-alone desktop app. Deliverables: - A desktop app - Server artifacts deployed to kubernetes.

## Main goals for GSoC 2022

The three main goals for this summer are-

- Enhancing the npm package
- Wrapping the npm package to a standalone cross platform desktop-app
- Server exposing REST apis

## Technology used 

The technologies used for different apps are-

#### Desktop app

- ElectronJs

#### Server app
- NodeJs
- TypeScript
- Express
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Kubernetes

:::info
In the community bonding period of GSoC it was agreed by the mentors and the assignee to use ElectronJs instead of the Flutter framework as described in the proposal.

While preparing the POC, we experimented with many different framework for creating desktopapp. And found that electronsjs suits best for your need. Since the core idea of this project was to wrap the nodejs package into a standalone desktopoapp and electron in its core using nodejs for the system apis call. 

It also provides a couple of cool features like: 
- Automatic updates
- Native menus & notifications
- Crash reporting
- Debugging & profiling
- Windows installers

considering these plus points mentors and assignee agrees to use ElectronJs

## Repository

The original repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/flexivian/flexbench) 

- The implementation stories are organized in issues and assigned to the project [GSoC-2022](https://github.com/orgs/flexivian/projects/1/views/4) for quick reference.
- All pull requests for GSoC 2021 can be found [here](https://github.com/flexivian/flexbench/pulls?q=).
- For the implementation [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) was used and all Pull Requests target the develop branch.
<!-- - All Pull Requests are squashed to one commit so that the history of the repository is cleaner. -->

## Quick Start

During the GSoC period work was done to easily set up a development environment and to quickly deploy the server app with docker-compose. A quickstart for both could be:

- **Development**: Setup development environment as [described](../Installation/development.md).
- **Production**: Setup a quick production build with Docker as [described](../Installation/production.md).

In addition, the current site was built from scratch to support structured and extensive documentation. This site's source code is committed to the Git repository of this project.

## Future Plans

#### For Desktop app

Since this is a desktop app there is always a scope of development to this project.
The 

- Planning to add a feature for working as a team to collaborate work just as Postman offers. 
- Feature to add documentation for the apis. 
- Rest will be discussing with the organization post gsoc period.
- Additions to the frontend client.

#### For Server app

- To implement Elasticsearch and redis mqueue for large throughputs and throttling
